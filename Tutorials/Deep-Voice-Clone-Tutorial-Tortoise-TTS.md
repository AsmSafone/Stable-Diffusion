
### Part 1 - Preparing training speech files
We will begin with pre-processing the speech training file

First accept the license terms on https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation 

To do that we will git clone and install ozen toolkit : https://github.com/devilismyfriend/ozen-toolkit

```git clone https://github.com/devilismyfriend/ozen-toolkit```

To be able to use this, you need to have installed Anaconda
Anaconda download and install link : https://www.anaconda.com/download

If you fail to install Anaconda here my tutorial where I installed and shown : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJebdQ30UZQ

Then double click and run "Set Up Ozen.bat" file inside directory 

Lets say something went wrong and you want to reinstall or, you had installed this repo before and you want to reinstall, then Anaconda will give you this message

```CondaValueError: prefix already exists: C:\Users\King\miniconda3\envs\ozen```

So open folder ```C:\Users\King\miniconda3\envs``` and delete the ```ozen``` directory
