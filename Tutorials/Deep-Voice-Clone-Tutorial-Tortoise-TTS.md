We will begin with pre-processing the speech training file

First accept the license terms on https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation 

To do that we will git clone and install ozen toolkit : https://github.com/devilismyfriend/ozen-toolkit

```git clone https://github.com/devilismyfriend/ozen-toolkit```

To be able to use this, you need to have installed Anaconda
Anaconda download and install link : https://www.anaconda.com/download
